# Project Overview:

The primary problem a Counselling System aims to
resolve is the efficient and organized management of student data. Specifically, the
system addresses:
Data Fragmentation: Student information is often spread across various platforms,
making it difficult to access and manage efficiently.

Manual Errors: Manual handling of student records can lead to errors in data entry,
which can affect attendance, grades, and other critical student information.
Accessibility: Students and staff may find it difficult to access their information
quickly and efficiently.
Communication Gaps: There can be a lack of effective communication between
students, counsellors, and admin staff.
Administrative Overload: Handling large volumes of student data manually is
time-consuming and labor-intensive for the administration.


# Data Perspective:
Data Collection: The SIMS collects data from various sources, including
attendance records, grades, and activities. This data is standardized and stored in a
central database.
Data Management: Counsellors can update and maintain student records
efficiently. This includes adding attendance data, updating grades, and logging
other activities.
Data Retrieval: Students can access their data to view attendance reports, grades,
and other records in real-time.
Data Accuracy: Automated data handling reduces errors associated with manual
data entry, ensuring that the data is accurate and up-to-date.
Data Security: The system ensures that sensitive student information is secure and
accessible only to authorized users.
